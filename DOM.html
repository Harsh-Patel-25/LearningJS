    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
        head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea
        for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the
        desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As with
        Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his
        system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography, Lee
        cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great
        influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he
        was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his
        autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of
        whether or not this is true.
